# Feature-Selection-with-Ant-Colony-Optimization-and-Evolutionary-Feature-Selection

Here, in this project, I compared the ability of two advanced feature selection- the `Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)` and the `Evolutionary Feature Selection (EFS)` in driving towards selecting the best number of features while maintaining optimum model performance

The popular Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset available on Kaggle was used for this project
